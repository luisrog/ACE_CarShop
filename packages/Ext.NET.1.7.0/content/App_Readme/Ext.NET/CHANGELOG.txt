	https://extnet.lighthouseapp.com/projects/50526-bugs/tickets/245

	The fix doesn't work if a user removes a field's text at all, because an empty string is not validated by Vtype on the TextField's getErrors level. To fix that problem I can suggest to set up the KeyUp listeners for DateFields and analyze a field's value - if it's empty then reset validation settings and validate. This is demonstrated in the Form/DateField/From-To_Range example.

	Also, there are two important changes which might be breaking.

	1. Now a NumberField with zero on client is not considered IsEmpty on server, i.e. IsEmpty property returns false instead of true.

	2. The NumberField's Number property returns double.MinValue for en empty NumberField instead of zero. You might need to analyze the IsEmpty property.

79. [FIX] [#3774] TreePanel remote mode "success" bug. 
	Repaired the revision #3772.

	Now when a TreePanel remote mode deals with a WebService or MVC controller action, 
	an "actionSuccess" parameter instead of "success" one must be sent.

	The reason of the change: a success flag of remote mode conflicted with a success flag of DirectEvent.

	Bug report.

	2) RemoteActionEventArgs doesn't allow to return custom response parameters.

     event. 
        
     Both "item" and "this" will refer to the same Component instance.
     
     It is recommended that developers refer to the Component instance as 
     "this", instead of "item", although both will work. 
     
     Using "this" instead of "item" will avoid any future breaking 
     changes.
     
     Example
     
     <ext:Panel runat="server" Title="Example">
	    <Listeners>
		    // Old
			<Hide Handler="alert(el);" />
	        
			// New
			<Hide Handler="alert(item);" />
	        
			// Recommended
			<Hide Handler="alert(this);" />
		</Listeners>
	 </ext:Panel>

76.  GroupName property of Radio widget is removed. Please use Name property.
     Please note that GroupName property of RadioGroup still exists (RadioGroup's GroupName is applied to each child Radio if AutomaticGrouping is true)
	
77.  LowerCase of RendererFormat enum is renamed to Lowercase (to correct name serialization)

78.  Renamed the ResourceManager property .RemoveViewState to .DisableViewState. 

     Example (old)
	 
	 <ext:ResourceManager runat="server" RemoveViewState="true" />
	 
	 Example (new)
	 
	 <ext:ResourceManager runat="server" DisableViewState="true" />
	 
79.  In prior releases, the Store .Load Listener was previously delayed by
     10 milliseconds. This delay was removed as of v1.0 RC2.

	 Projects configured to use the .Load Listener may require setting a
	 10 millisecond delay. 

	 Example

	 <Load Handler="..." Delay="10" />
